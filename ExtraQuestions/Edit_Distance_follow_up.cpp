/**
 * question is the extension of edit distance.
 * 
 * here the cost is also given.
 * for inserting the cost is a.
 * for deleting the cost is b.
 * for replace the cost is c.
 * 
 * 
 * now find the minimum cost to convert from s to t using minimum cost.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * sol : 
 * 
 * 
 * as inserting in one string is equal to deleting from another string.
 * 
 * so we will take the cost of insert and delete same which will be equal to min(insert , delete)
